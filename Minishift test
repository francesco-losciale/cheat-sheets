# The oc command can perform the same actions as the web console. 
# To create a new project run the following:

# create project
oc new-project wednesday \
--display-name=Wednesday \
--description="Today's new project"

# Create a new application within the project using a sample from OpenShift:
oc new-app \
centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

# When you need to run another build
oc start-build ruby-ex

# Watch your build process
oc logs build/ruby-ex-1

# Wait for ruby pods to start up
oc get pods -w

# Check the IP and port the ruby-ex service is running on
oc get svc

# create an external route for your service
oc expose svc/ruby-ex --hostname=external-route-2


####################### Adding Webhooks and Making Code Changes ################################
Since OpenShift V3 does not provide a git repository out of the box, you can configure your github repository to make a webhook call whenever you push your code.

From the console navigate to your project.
Click on Browse > Builds
From the view for your Build click on the link to display your GitHub webhook and copy the url.
Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on repository settings > webhooks
Paste your copied webhook url provided by OpenShift
Change the Content type to application/json - Thats it!
After you save your webhook, if you refresh your settings page you can see the status of the ping that Github sent to OpenShift to verify it can reach the server.


############### OKD ##################################

OKD is a distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment. OKD also serves as the upstream code base upon which Red Hat OpenShift Online and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform are built.

https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/index.html


Using oc new-app, OKD automatically detects whether the Docker, Pipeline or Source build strategy should be used, and in the case of Source builds, detects an appropriate language builder image.

If a Jenkinsfile exists in the root or specified context directory of the source repository when creating a new application, OKD generates a Pipeline build strategy. Otherwise, if a Dockerfile is found, OKD generates a Docker build strategy. Otherwise, it generates a Source build strategy.

You can create an application from a previously stored template or from a template file, by specifying the name of the template as an argument. 



################# OpenShift POD for Jenkins ##################################
This sample walks through the process of login to an OpenShift cluster and deploying a Jenkins Pod in it. It also configures a simple application and then creates a Jenkins job to trigger a build of that application.

The Jenkins job will trigger OpenShift to build+deploy a test version of the application, validate that the deployment works, and then tag the test version into production.
