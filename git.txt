##### how to change author of one specific commit #######

Assume for clarity of exposition that 03f482d6 is the commit whose author we are trying to replace, and 42627abe is the commit with the new author.

Checkout the commit we are trying to modify.

git checkout 03f482d6
Make the author change.

git commit --amend --author "New Author Name <New Author Email>"
Now we have a new commit with hash assumed to be 42627abe.

Checkout the original branch.

Replace the old commit with the new one locally.

git replace 03f482d6 42627abe
Rewrite all future commits based on the replacement.

git filter-branch -- --all
Remove the replacement for cleanliness.

git replace -d 03f482d6
Push the new history (only use --force if the below fails, and only after sanity checking with git log and/or git diff).

git push --force-with-lease
Instead of 4-6 you can just rebase onto new commit:

git rebase -i 42627abe
